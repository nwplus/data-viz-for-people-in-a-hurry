# Data Visualization (with R) for People in a Hurry

This workshop serves as a quick and dirty introduction to data science fundamentals, with a focus on visualization. It is currently a part of nwPlus' Workshop Series happening this fall. The title is loosely inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson's "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry."

### Pre-requisites

None! To take part in this workshop, just show up ready to learn. All coding will take place on UBC's Syzygy servers. Access the server [here](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/). If you don't have access to UBC's servers, that's no problem! You can also access the starter file with Google Colab, available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/b). The key point is that **no environment setup is required to participate**.

## Setup

### Getting setup with Syzygy

1. First download the starter file, available [here](0-data-viz-for-people-in-a-hurry-blank.ipynb).
2. Then, head to either UBC's Syzygy servers.
3. Hit `File` > `Upload` from the top context menu.
4. Upload the starter file.
5. Open the file!

Once you begin, you'll need to uncomment all of the lines in the first cell and run the first cell to install the necessary dependencies. This will be covered in the workshop.

### Getting setup with Google Colab

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Hit `File` > `Open` from the top context menu, or `CTRL + O` (or `CMD + O` if you're on a Mac).
3. Choose the GitHub option, and enter the following link: `https://github.com/nwplus/data-viz-for-people-in-a-hurry`
4. Select the file called `0-data-viz-for-people-in-a-hurry.ipynb` (it should be first in the list of files that appear).
5. And you're down!

Once you begin, you'll need to uncomment all of the lines in the first cell and run the first cell to install the necessary dependencies. This will be covered in the workshop.

Here are some helpful screenshots of the steps I just described.
